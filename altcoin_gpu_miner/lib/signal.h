/* The three most frequent use cases of these macros are:

   * For providing a substitute for a function that is missing on some
     platforms, but is declared and works fine on the platforms on which
     it exists:

       #if @GNULIB_FOO@
       # if !@HAVE_FOO@
       _GL_FUNCDECL_SYS (foo, ...);
       # endif
       _GL_CXXALIAS_SYS (foo, ...);
       _GL_CXXALIASWARN (foo);
       #elif defined GNULIB_POSIXCHECK
       ...
       #endif

   * For providing a replacement for a function that exists on all platforms,
     but is broken/insufficient and needs to be replaced on some platforms:

       #if @GNULIB_FOO@
       # if @REPLACE_FOO@
       #  if !(defined __cplusplus && defined GNULIB_NAMESPACE)
       #   undef foo
       #   define foo rpl_foo
       #  endif
       _GL_FUNCDECL_RPL (foo, ...);
       _GL_CXXALIAS_RPL (foo, ...);
       # else
       _GL_CXXALIAS_SYS (foo, ...);
       # endif
       _GL_CXXALIASWARN (foo);
       #elif defined GNULIB_POSIXCHECK
       ...
       #endif

   * For providing a replacement for a function that exists on some platforms
     but is broken/insufficient and needs to be replaced on some of them and
     is additionally either missing or undeclared on some other platforms:

       #if @GNULIB_FOO@
       # if @REPLACE_FOO@
       #  if !(defined __cplusplus && defined GNULIB_NAMESPACE)
       #   undef foo
       #   define foo rpl_foo
       #  endif
       _GL_FUNCDECL_RPL (foo, ...);
       _GL_CXXALIAS_RPL (foo, ...);
       # else
       #  if !@HAVE_FOO@   or   if !@HAVE_DECL_FOO@
       _GL_FUNCDECL_SYS (foo, ...);
       #  endif
       _GL_CXXALIAS_SYS (foo, ...);
       # endif
       _GL_CXXALIASWARN (foo);
