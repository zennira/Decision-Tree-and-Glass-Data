I have said to select English for the install process for 2 reasons:
1) I don't know any other spoken language very well
and
2) I'm not sure what problems installing under a different language
might cause (it will probably cause no problems but I don't know)

Short hardware comment:
Your mining computer doesn't need any HDD or CD/DVD/BD as long as it has at
least 2GB of RAM, can boot USB, has some network connection to the internet
and of course a reasonable mining ATI graphics card
... Or you can boot a windows PC with the USB to only do mining ... and ignore
the system HDD ... wasting energy running the HDD (roughly 10 Watts per HDD) :)

If you wish to install to an HDD instead of a USB,
 see the changes to the instructions at the end

To create the USB, you need of course a 4GB USB and temporarily need a PC
with a CD (or DVD/BD) writer, a USB port and of course an internet
connection to the PC

1) Download the xubuntu 11.04 desktop live CD iso for amd64
