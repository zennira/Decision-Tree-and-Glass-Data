$0 [OPTION]... PROGRAM [ARGUMENT]...

Handle \`PROGRAM [ARGUMENT]...' for when PROGRAM is missing, or return an
error status if there is no known handling for PROGRAM.

Options:
  -h, --help      display this help and exit
  -v, --version   output version information and exit
  --run           try to run the given command, and emulate it if it fails

Supported PROGRAM values:
  aclocal      touch file \`aclocal.m4'
  autoconf     touch file \`configure'
  autoheader   touch file \`config.h.in'
  autom4te     touch the output file, or create a stub one
  automake     touch all \`Makefile.in' files
  bison        create \`y.tab.[ch]', if possible, from existing .[ch]
  flex         create \`lex.yy.c', if possible, from existing .c
  help2man     touch the output file
  lex          create \`lex.yy.c', if possible, from existing .c
  makeinfo     touch the output file
  tar          try tar, gnutar, gtar, then tar without non-portable flags
  yacc         create \`y.tab.[ch]', if possible, from existing .[ch]

Version suffixes to PROGRAM as well as the prefixes \`gnu-', \`gnu', and
\`g' are ignored when checking the name.
