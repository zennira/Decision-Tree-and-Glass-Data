Version 2.5
===========

Released 2013-09-19

* New features:

  - `json_pack()` and friends: Add format specifiers ``s#``, ``+`` and
    ``+#``.

  - Add ``JSON_DECODE_INT_AS_REAL`` decoding flag to treat all numbers
    as real in the decoder (#123).

  - Add `json_array_foreach()`, paralleling `json_object_foreach()`
    (#118).

* Bug fixes:

  - `json_dumps()` and friends: Don't crash if json is *NULL* and
    ``JSON_ENCODE_ANY`` is set.

  - Fix a theoretical integer overflow in `jsonp_strdup()`.

  - Fix `l_isxdigit()` macro (#97).

  - Fix an off-by-one error in `json_array_remove()`.

* Build:

  - Support CMake in addition to GNU Autotools (#106, #107, #112,
    #115, #120, #127).

  - Support building for Android (#109).

  - Don't use ``-Werror`` by default.

  - Support building and testing with VPATH (#93).

  - Fix compilation when ``NDEBUG`` is defined (#128)

* Tests:

  - Fix a refleak in ``test/bin/json_process.c``.

* Documentation:

  - Clarify the return value of `json_load_callback_t`.

  - Document how to circumvent problems with separate heaps on Windows.

  - Fix memory leaks and warnings in ``github_commits.c``.

  - Use `json_decref()` properly in tutorial.

* Other:

  - Make it possible to forward declare ``struct json_t``.


Version 2.4
===========

Released 2012-09-23

* New features:

  - Add `json_boolean()` macro that returns the JSON true or false
    value based on its argument (#86).

  - Add `json_load_callback()` that calls a callback function
    repeatedly to read the JSON input (#57).

  - Add JSON_ESCAPE_SLASH encoding flag to escape all occurences of
    ``/`` with ``\/``.

* Bug fixes:

  - Check for and reject NaN and Inf values for reals. Encoding these
    values resulted in invalid JSON.

  - Fix `json_real_set()` to return -1 on error.

* Build:

  - Jansson now builds on Windows with Visual Studio 2010, and
    includes solution and project files in ``win32/vs2010/``
    directory.

  - Fix build warnings (#77, #78).

  - Add ``-no-undefined`` to LDFLAGS (#90).

* Tests:

  - Fix the symbol exports test on Linux/PPC64 (#88).

* Documentation:

  - Fix typos (#73, #84).


Version 2.3.1
=============

Released 2012-04-20

* Build issues:

  - Only use ``long long`` if ``strtoll()`` is also available.

* Documentation:

  - Fix the names of library version constants in documentation. (#52)

  - Change the tutorial to use GitHub API v3. (#65)

* Tests:

  - Make some tests locale independent. (#51)

  - Distribute the library exports test in the tarball.

  - Make test run on shells that don't support the ``export FOO=bar``
    syntax.


Version 2.3
===========

Released 2012-01-27

* New features:

  - `json_unpack()` and friends: Add support for optional object keys
    with the ``{s?o}`` syntax.

  - Add `json_object_update_existing()` and
    `json_object_update_missing()`, for updating only existing keys or
    only adding missing keys to an object. (#37)

  - Add `json_object_foreach()` for more convenient iteration over
    objects. (#45, #46)

  - When decoding JSON, write the number of bytes that were read from
    input to ``error.position`` also on success. This is handy with
    ``JSON_DISABLE_EOF_CHECK``.

  - Add support for decoding any JSON value, not just arrays or
    objects. The support is enabled with the new ``JSON_DECODE_ANY``
    flag. Patch by Andrea Marchesini. (#4)

* Bug fixes

  - Avoid problems with object's serial number growing too big. (#40,
    #41)

  - Decoding functions now return NULL if the first argument is NULL.
    Patch by Andrea Marchesini.

  - Include ``jansson_config.h.win32`` in the distribution tarball.

  - Remove ``+`` and leading zeros from exponents in the encoder.
    (#39)

    separate threads. (#42)

  - Document MinGW support.

    `json_unpack()`. (#31)
